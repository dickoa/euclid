**WIP**

euclid aims to provide a comprehensive interface to the CGAL library for computational geometry. At its core it provides new vector types for all of the geometric primitives defined for the 2 and 3 dimensional kernel. These vector types maps directly into C++ structures ensuring that no conversion back and forth between R and C++ takes place. This, in turn, ensures that geometric calculations remain exact and free of any rounding errors or issues with floating point arithmetic.

The plan is to gradually expand the algorithms that euclid support once the vector foundation is established

## Installation
For now, euclid can be installed from github using remotes:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("thomasp85/euclid")
```

## Example
The package is still quite shallow but have rudimentary support for points and circles

```{r}
library(euclid)

# Construct some exact numbers
random_num <- exact_numeric(runif(20, max = 10))

# Exact numbers behave much like R numerics (though not everything is possible)
random_num[1:5]
max(random_num)
sort(random_num)
random_num[2] * 10
random_num[5] + random_num[16]
cumsum(random_num)

# With exact numbers we can construct our geometries

# 2 dimensions
p1 <- point(random_num[1:5], random_num[6:10])
p1

# circle based on center and radius
circle(p1, random_num[11:15])

# circle based on 2 points
circle(p1, point(random_num[11:15], random_num[16:20]))

# 3 dimensions
point(random_num[1:5], random_num[6:10], random_num[11:15])


```

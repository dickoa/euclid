\description{
These functions provide approximate measures of length, area, and volume of
geometries where relevant. The reason for approximation is that some measures
require square root operations or multiplication by Ï€, both operations where
exactness is necessarily lost. Not all geometries have meaningful measures,
e.g. a direction is dimensionless, a line is without area, and a circle has
no volume. Some geometries are infinite in some measures, e.g. a plane has an
infinite area. The return value will reflect this.
